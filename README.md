# Statistical Analysis of Social Network Usage Patterns

## Abstract
This project investigates social network usage patterns and their potential impact on users' daily lives and mental health. Data were collected from 52 respondents via a Google Forms survey, covering variables such as age, time spent on social networks, primary purposes, and mental health effects. The study employed Python for statistical analysis and data visualization, including descriptive statistics, distribution analysis, and graphical representation. 

Key findings reveal:
- The majority of respondents are aged 18-24 years, with Instagram being the most popular social network.
- Most respondents spend 1-4 hours daily on social media.
- Some respondents report feelings of dependency or occasional stress related to their usage.

This study highlights the importance of understanding social network behavior to improve mental health awareness and guide further research. **Limitations** include a small sample size and potential response biases.

## Introduction
Social networks have become integral to daily life, connecting people globally and providing platforms for communication, information sharing, and entertainment. As usage grows, understanding individuals' interactions with these platforms and their potential effects on well-being becomes increasingly important.

This study focuses on analyzing usage patterns and preferences to uncover trends in:
- Demographics
- Time spent on social networks
- Mental health impacts

Data were collected via a Google Forms survey completed by 52 participants. Statistical analysis and Python-based tools were utilized to generate insights, combining descriptive statistics and graphical visualizations. The findings aim to inform further research and raise awareness of social media’s impact on mental health.

## Methods

### Data Collection
Survey questions covered:
- Age group
- Favorite social networks
- Average daily time spent
- Primary purpose for using social networks
- Dependency and stress levels
- Perceived mental health impact

The survey was designed for anonymity, encouraging honest responses.

### Statistical Analysis
Python and its libraries were used for analysis:
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Frequency counts for categorical data
- **Distribution Analysis**: Histograms and box plots for age groups and daily time spent
- **Graphical Representation**: Bar charts and visualizations of patterns
- **Correlation Analysis**: Relationships between time spent and stress levels (if applicable)

### Tools Used
- **pandas**: Data manipulation
- **matplotlib & seaborn**: Visualization
- **scipy**: Statistical calculations

### 1. Age Distribution
The survey revealed that the majority of respondents were aged 18-24 years, making up 73% of the sample. Other age groups, such as 25-34 years and Under 18 years, had significantly fewer respondents, highlighting a younger demographic's active engagement with social networks.

### 2. Daily Time Spent
Respondents reported varying amounts of time spent on social networks daily:

- **1-2 hours**: 35%
- **2-4 hours**: 38%
- **Less than an hour**: 12%
- **4-6 hours**: 10%
- **More than 6 hours**: 5%

The results suggest that most users spend moderate amounts of time (1-4 hours) daily on social networks.

### 4. Dependency and Stress Levels

**Dependency**: Around 60% of respondents reported feeling "Sometimes" dependent on social networks, while 30% claimed they did not feel dependent at all.

**Stress**: Most respondents (50%) reported "Never" or "Rarely" experiencing stress due to social networks, while 25% reported occasional stress.

**Interpretation**: While dependency is a recurring theme, stress appears less prevalent among respondents.

### 5. Perceived Impact on Mental Health
- **Neutral**: 50% of respondents reported a neutral impact of social networks on their mental health.
- **Somewhat Positive**: 30% indicated a positive influence.
- **Somewhat Negative**: 15% indicated negative effects.
This suggests that, for most users, social networks are neither strongly beneficial nor harmful but have some influence on mental well-being.

## Discussion
The results of this study highlight several important insights into social network usage patterns and their perceived effects on mental health.

---# Social Networks and Their Impact: Study Overview

## 1. Dependency on Social Networks
This study explored the level of dependency users have on social networks. Key findings include:
- **60%** of respondents feel "Sometimes" dependent on social networks.
- **30%** indicated no dependency at all.

Social networks appear to be habitual but not indispensable for many. Occasional dependency suggests their role in fostering social connections and providing information.

---

## 2. Stress and Mental Health
Stress associated with social network use is relatively low:
- Most respondents reported "Never" or "Rarely" experiencing stress.
- **25%** experienced occasional stress due to factors such as:
  - Negative interactions.
  - Overwhelming content.
  - Unrealistic comparisons.

### Mental Health Impact Distribution:
- **54.9%** reported a neutral impact on mental health.
- **15.7%** experienced a somewhat positive impact, citing support, entertainment, or engagement.
- **7.8%** noted negative impacts, such as anxiety or reduced self-esteem.

---

## 3. Popularity of Social Networks
The study highlights preferences among social network users:
- **Instagram** was the most popular platform, valued for its visual content and interactive features (e.g., stories, reels).
- **TikTok** was especially popular among younger users for its short-form content.
- **Facebook** and **YouTube** maintained smaller but steady user bases, reflecting their ongoing relevance.

---

## Recommendations
Based on these findings, the following recommendations are proposed:
1. **Promote Digital Literacy:** Educate users on managing screen time and reducing addictive patterns.
2. **Encourage Positive Interactions:** Platforms should minimize negative interactions and promote supportive, engaging content.
3. **Balance Content:** Encourage users to consume a mix of entertaining, educational, and social content for better mental well-being.

---

## Limitations
- **Sample Size:** The small respondent pool (52 participants) limits the generalizability of findings.
- **Self-Reporting Bias:** Participants’ responses may reflect self-perception rather than objective usage patterns.

Future research should address these limitations by including larger, more diverse samples and exploring user demographics (e.g., age, occupation, geography).

---

## Conclusion
Social networks play a vital but not overwhelming role in users’ lives. Most users report moderate dependency and low stress levels, suggesting effective management of their interactions. Platforms like Instagram and TikTok dominate due to their engaging content formats.

While social media can positively impact mental health, offering entertainment and connection, a small proportion of users report negative effects, emphasizing the need for healthier digital habits.

### Key Takeaways:
- Raise awareness about responsible social media usage.
- Provide tools to help users balance their digital consumption.
- Conduct further studies to explore specific aspects of social media use.
