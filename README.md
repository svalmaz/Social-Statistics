# Statistical Analysis of Social Network Usage Patterns

## Abstract
This project investigates social network usage patterns and their potential impact on users' daily lives and mental health. Data were collected from 52 respondents via a Google Forms survey, covering variables such as age, time spent on social networks, primary purposes, and mental health effects. The study employed Python for statistical analysis and data visualization, including descriptive statistics, distribution analysis, and graphical representation. 

Key findings reveal:
- The majority of respondents are aged 18-24 years, with Instagram being the most popular social network.
- Most respondents spend 1-4 hours daily on social media.
- Some respondents report feelings of dependency or occasional stress related to their usage.

This study highlights the importance of understanding social network behavior to improve mental health awareness and guide further research. **Limitations** include a small sample size and potential response biases.

## Introduction
Social networks have become integral to daily life, connecting people globally and providing platforms for communication, information sharing, and entertainment. As usage grows, understanding individuals' interactions with these platforms and their potential effects on well-being becomes increasingly important.

This study focuses on analyzing usage patterns and preferences to uncover trends in:
- Demographics
- Time spent on social networks
- Mental health impacts

Data were collected via a Google Forms survey completed by 52 participants. Statistical analysis and Python-based tools were utilized to generate insights, combining descriptive statistics and graphical visualizations. The findings aim to inform further research and raise awareness of social mediaâ€™s impact on mental health.

## Methods

### Data Collection
Survey questions covered:
- Age group
- Favorite social networks
- Average daily time spent
- Primary purpose for using social networks
- Dependency and stress levels
- Perceived mental health impact

The survey was designed for anonymity, encouraging honest responses.

### Statistical Analysis
Python and its libraries were used for analysis:
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Frequency counts for categorical data
- **Distribution Analysis**: Histograms and box plots for age groups and daily time spent
- **Graphical Representation**: Bar charts and visualizations of patterns
- **Correlation Analysis**: Relationships between time spent and stress levels (if applicable)

### Tools Used
- **pandas**: Data manipulation
- **matplotlib & seaborn**: Visualization
- **scipy**: Statistical calculations

### 1. Age Distribution
The survey revealed that the majority of respondents were aged 18-24 years, making up 73% of the sample. Other age groups, such as 25-34 years and Under 18 years, had significantly fewer respondents, highlighting a younger demographic's active engagement with social networks.

### 2. Daily Time Spent
Respondents reported varying amounts of time spent on social networks daily:

- **1-2 hours**: 35%
- **2-4 hours**: 38%
- **Less than an hour**: 12%
- **4-6 hours**: 10%
- **More than 6 hours**: 5%

The results suggest that most users spend moderate amounts of time (1-4 hours) daily on social networks.

### 4. Dependency and Stress Levels

**Dependency**: Around 60% of respondents reported feeling "Sometimes" dependent on social networks, while 30% claimed they did not feel dependent at all.

**Stress**: Most respondents (50%) reported "Never" or "Rarely" experiencing stress due to social networks, while 25% reported occasional stress.

**Interpretation**: While dependency is a recurring theme, stress appears less prevalent among respondents.

### 5. Perceived Impact on Mental Health
- **Neutral**: 50% of respondents reported a neutral impact of social networks on their mental health.
- **Somewhat Positive**: 30% indicated a positive influence.
- **Somewhat Negative**: 15% indicated negative effects.
This suggests that, for most users, social networks are neither strongly beneficial nor harmful but have some influence on mental well-being.
