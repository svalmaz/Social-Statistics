# Statistical Analysis of Social Network Usage Patterns

## Abstract
This project investigates social network usage patterns and their potential impact on users' daily lives and mental health. Data were collected from 52 respondents via a Google Forms survey, covering variables such as age, time spent on social networks, primary purposes, and mental health effects. The study employed Python for statistical analysis and data visualization, including descriptive statistics, distribution analysis, and graphical representation. 

Key findings reveal:
- The majority of respondents are aged 18-24 years, with Instagram being the most popular social network.
- Most respondents spend 1-4 hours daily on social media.
- Some respondents report feelings of dependency or occasional stress related to their usage.

This study highlights the importance of understanding social network behavior to improve mental health awareness and guide further research. **Limitations** include a small sample size and potential response biases.

## Introduction
Social networks have become integral to daily life, connecting people globally and providing platforms for communication, information sharing, and entertainment. As usage grows, understanding individuals' interactions with these platforms and their potential effects on well-being becomes increasingly important.

This study focuses on analyzing usage patterns and preferences to uncover trends in:
- Demographics
- Time spent on social networks
- Mental health impacts

Data were collected via a Google Forms survey completed by 52 participants. Statistical analysis and Python-based tools were utilized to generate insights, combining descriptive statistics and graphical visualizations. The findings aim to inform further research and raise awareness of social mediaâ€™s impact on mental health.
