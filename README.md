#Statistical Analysis of Social Network Usage Patterns

##Abstract
This project investigates social network usage patterns and their potential impact on users' daily lives and mental health. Data were collected from 52 respondents via a Google Forms survey, covering variables such as age, time spent on social networks, primary purposes, and mental health effects. The study employed Python for statistical analysis and data visualization, including descriptive statistics, distribution analysis, and graphical representation. Key findings reveal that the majority of respondents are aged 18-24 years, with Instagram being the most popular social network. Most respondents spend 1-4 hours daily on social media, and some report feelings of dependency or occasional stress related to their usage. The study highlights the importance of understanding social network behavior to improve mental health awareness and guide further research. Limitations include a small sample size and potential response biases.

Introduction
Social networks have become integral to daily life, connecting people across the globe and providing platforms for communication, information sharing, and entertainment. As the use of social media grows, it is increasingly important to understand how individuals interact with these platforms and the potential effects on their well-being. This study focuses on analyzing the usage patterns and preferences of social network users, aiming to uncover trends in demographics, time spent, and impacts on mental health.
The objective of this research is to investigate the most popular social networks, understand usage habits, and explore the relationship between social media use and factors like dependency and stress. The data for this study were collected via a Google Forms survey, where 52 participants provided responses to questions about their favorite platforms, daily usage, purposes for engaging with social networks, and perceived mental health effects.
The analysis utilizes statistical techniques and Python-based tools to generate insights. By combining descriptive statistics with graphical visualizations, this study seeks to highlight the dynamics of social network usage and its implications for users' daily lives. The findings aim to inform further research and promote awareness of social mediaâ€™s impact on mental health.

Methods
Data Collection
Data were collected using a Google Forms survey designed to gather information about respondents' social network usage habits. The survey included multiple-choice and open-ended questions covering:
Age group.
Favorite social network platforms.
Average daily time spent on social networks.
Primary purpose of using social networks.
Dependency and stress levels related to social media usage.
Perceived impact on mental health.
A total of 52 responses were received, forming the basis for statistical analysis. The survey was designed to ensure anonymity and encourage honest responses.

Statistical Analysis
The data were analyzed using Python and its associated libraries:
Descriptive Statistics: Basic measures, such as frequency counts, were calculated for categorical data.
Distribution Analysis: Histograms and box plots were used to examine the distribution of age groups and daily time spent.
Graphical Representation: Bar charts and box plots were generated to visualize patterns in responses.
Correlation Analysis (if applicable): Relationships between variables, such as time spent and stress levels, were explored.

Tools Used
The following Python libraries were employed for data processing and analysis:
pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
matplotlib and seaborn: For creating detailed visualizations.
scipy: For statistical calculations, including correlation analysis.


Results
The results of this study are based on the analysis of the collected survey data. Each subsection presents key findings along with appropriate visualizations.

1. Age Distribution
The survey revealed that the majority of respondents were aged 18-24 years, making up 73% of the sample. Other age groups, such as 25-34 years and Under 18 years, had significantly fewer respondents, highlighting a younger demographic's active engagement with social networks.
